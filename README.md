# Micropython stubs
This script generates as output the API-Stubs based on the input of the micropython-documentation. All the `restructured`-files are parsed and processed into python files with documentation.

# ToDo
- [ ] Clean the code
- [ ] Use a library to parse RST instead of hacky hacky substring comparisons

# Disclaimer
This is a proof-of-concept at best. Do not use for production.
